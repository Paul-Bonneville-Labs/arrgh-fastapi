   "source": "# LLM Experimentation Notebook\n\nThis notebook is designed for **experimenting with LLM-based interactions**, specifically for entity extraction and newsletter processing.\n\n## Purpose\n\n🧪 **LLM Experimentation**: Test different prompts, models, and parameters  \n📊 **Entity Extraction Analysis**: Analyze extraction quality and tune confidence thresholds  \n🔍 **Prompt Engineering**: Iterate on prompts to improve extraction accuracy  \n📈 **Performance Testing**: Test with real newsletter data and measure results  \n\n## What This Notebook Does\n\n- **Imports Production Modules**: Uses actual FastAPI EntityExtractor for testing\n- **Prompt Experimentation**: Test different prompt templates and approaches\n- **Data Analysis**: Analyze entity extraction results and quality metrics\n- **Interactive Testing**: Test with real newsletter content\n- **Performance Benchmarking**: Measure extraction speed and accuracy\n\n## What This Notebook Doesn't Do\n\n- **Infrastructure Code**: All production logic lives in `src/` directory\n- **Duplicate Implementation**: Uses FastAPI modules directly\n- **Production Deployment**: This is for experimentation only\n\n## Quick Start\n\n1. **Start FastAPI Development Server**: `./scripts/dev-server.sh`\n2. **Run This Notebook**: Experiment with LLM interactions\n3. **Apply Learnings**: Update production code in `src/processors/entity_extractor.py`\n\n---\n\n**📚 For development workflow, see: [docs/DEVELOPMENT-WORKFLOW.md](../docs/DEVELOPMENT-WORKFLOW.md)**"

Primary Development in FastAPI**\n- Edit code in `src/` directory\n- Use `uvicorn --reload` for instant feedback\n- Write and run unit tests with pytest\n- Use debugger and logging for exploration\n\n### **2. Interactive Testing in Notebook** \n- Import updated FastAPI modules automatically\n- Test with real newsletter data\n- Analyze entity extraction results\n- Visualize Neo4j graph data\n- Experiment with prompts and configurations\n\n### **3. Quality Assurance**\n- All tests in `tests/` directory validate production code\n- Notebook testing supplements unit tests with real data\n- Entity extraction tests ensure production reliability\n\n## **Next Steps**\n\n1. **Start FastAPI Development**: `uvicorn src.main:app --reload --port 8000`\n2. **Run Tests**: `pytest --watch tests/`\n3. **Use Notebook for Analysis**: Import modules and test interactively\n4. **Deploy Changes**: Push to production knowing notebook validates behavior\n\n## **File Structure**\n```\nsrc/                          # Production code (single source of truth)\n├── processors/\n│   ├── entity_extractor.py   # Production entity extraction\n│   └── html_processor.py     # Production HTML processing\n├── graph/\n│   └── neo4j_client.py       # Production Neo4j client\n└── workflows/\n    └── newsletter_processor.py # Production workflow\n\ntests/                        # Comprehensive test suite\n├── test_entity_extractor.py  # Entity extraction tests\n├── test_newsletter.py        # Integration tests\n└── test_simple.py           # Basic functionality tests\n\nnotebooks/                    # Interactive analysis only\n└── newsletter_development.ipynb # This notebook (imports from src/)\n```\n\n**🎯 The notebook is now a consumer of production code, not a parallel implementation!**"
